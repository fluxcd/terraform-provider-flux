### Customizing Flux

The Flux controller deployments, container command arguments, node affinity, etc can be customized using [Kustomize strategic merge patches and JSON patches](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/patchMultipleObjects.md).
The Kustomize file is configured through the `kustomize_override` argument. Below are some examples of use cases when customizing Flux is useful, refer to the [customization examples documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/patchMultipleObjects.md) for more examples.

{{ tffile "examples/resources/flux_bootstrap_git/customize.tf" }}

#### Safe to evict

Allow the cluster autoscaler to evict the Flux controller pods.

{{ codefile "yaml" "examples/resources/flux_bootstrap_git/kustomization-evict.yaml" }}

#### Node affinity and tolerations

Pin the Flux controllers to specific nodes.

{{ codefile "yaml" "examples/resources/flux_bootstrap_git/kustomization-node.yaml" }}

## Import

Existing Flux installations can be imported by passing the namespace where Flux is installed.

{{ codefile "sh" .ImportFile }}
