## 0.12.0

**Release date:** 2022-03-23

This prerelease includes flux2 [v0.28.2](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.28.2).

Flux v0.28 comes with breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes.
Please see the [Upgrade Flux to the Source v1beta2 API](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/discussions/2567)
discussion for more details.

### Breaking changes

With the introduction of Source v1beta2, there is a breaking change that
requires a manual state update.

All that is required is to remove the `kubectl_manifest` resource for the
GitRepository manifest. This will cause the kubectl provider to overwrite the
existing manifest.

```shell
terraform state rm 'kubectl_manifest.sync["source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1/gitrepository/flux-system/flux-system"]'
```

Future versions of the provider will solve this long term.
