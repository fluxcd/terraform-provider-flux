## 1.0.0-rc.5

**Release date:** 2023-06-01

This release includes flux2 [v2.0.0-rc.5](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.5).

Flux `v2.0.0-rc.5` addresses a regression that was introduced in `v2.0.0-rc.4`.
This regression caused a disruption in the compatibility with Git servers
utilizing v2 of the wire protocol, such as Azure Devops and AWS CodeCommit.

## 1.0.0-rc.4

**Release date:** 2023-05-29

This release includes flux2 [v2.0.0-rc.4](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.4).

## 1.0.0-rc.3

**Release date:** 2023-05-12

This release includes flux2 [v2.0.0-rc.3](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.3).

## 1.0.0-rc.2

**Release date:** 2023-05-10

This release includes flux2 [v2.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.2).

This release includes the new attribute `disable_secret_creation` in the `flux_bootstrap_git` resource. This empowers users to override the git credentials used by Flux inside of the Kubernetes cluster.

## 1.0.0-rc.1

**Release date:** 2023-04-11

This release includes flux2 [v2.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1).

The datasources `flux_install` and `flux_sync` are deprecated, with a warning about their removal in the future. Users of the datasources should migrate to the `flux_bootstrap_git` resources using the [migration guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/fluxcd/flux/latest/docs/guides/migrating-to-resource).

This release also implements a timeout configuration for `flux_bootstrap_git` which enables retrying of update actions when multiple commits are pushed in parallel.

## 0.25.3

**Release date:** 2023-03-21

This prerelease includes flux2 [v0.41.2](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.41.2).

## 0.25.2

**Release date:** 2023-03-20

This prerelease includes flux2 [v0.41.1](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.41.1).

Fixes errors caused by passing computed values to certain Git configuration attributes in the provider by delaying the reading of the attributes.

## 0.25.1

**Release date:** 2023-03-10

This prerelease includes flux2 [v0.41.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.41.0).

Fixes to components extra configuration in `flux_install` datasource which caused it to not be included in the generated manifests.

## 0.25.0

**Release date:** 2023-03-09

This prerelease includes flux2 [v0.41.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.41.0).

This release contains a breaking configuration change. The git repository configuration including the credentials has been moved from the `flux_bootstrap_git` resource to the provider block. Detailed information can be found in the [documentation](./docs/guides/breaking-provider-configuration.md).

## 0.24.2

**Release date:** 2023-02-28

This prerelease includes flux2 [v0.40.2](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.40.2).

## 0.24.1

**Release date:** 2023-02-23

This prerelease includes flux2 [v0.40.1](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.40.1).

## 0.24.0

**Release date:** 2023-02-20

This prerelease includes flux2 [v0.40.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.40.0).

This release contains a breaking change with the removal of the `git_implementation` attribute from the `flux_sync` data source. The libgit2 implementation has been removed from Flux as the `go-git` implementation supports all Git servers, including Azure DevOps and AWS CodeCommit.

Some minor fixes have been made to the new `flux_bootstrap_git` resource as users were experiencing issues setting custom components configuration.

## 0.23.0

**Release date:** 2023-02-02

This prerelease includes flux2 [v0.39.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.39.0).

A new resource `flux_bootstrap_git` has been added as a replacement to the current two data source.

Bootstrapping Flux with Terraform has been a feature that was available early on in Fluxcd V2 development. With time new features in Flux and more requirements from end users have made the experience complex and error-prone.
A big reason is that the solution was built with a focus on using existing providers to manage the interaction with Git and Kubernetes. While it saved time early on it caused issues in the long run.
Flux has specific requirements in the order resources are applied and removed to work properly, which became very difficult to express with Terraform. In the worst case, Terraform would not be able to run at all due to the dependency complexity.

Over the last couple of months, a new provider resource has been developed to replace the old bootstrapping method. The resource implements all the functionality required to bootstrap Flux, removing the dependency on third-party Terraform providers.
The goal has been to replicate the features offered by the Flux CLI as close as possible while solving long-standing issues current users experience with the provider.

Currently customizing the Flux installation has issues as it only affects how Flux reconciles itself but now how the manifests are applied to Kubernetes. This results in issues for the end user as their cluster may block Pods lacking specific security settings.
This issue is no longer present in the new solution as the provider manages both the process of committing the customized configuration to Git and applying it to Kubernetes.

Another long-standing issue has been uninstalling Flux with Terraform. The old solution was for the most part luck based if the resources were removed in the right order and enough time was allowed for finalizers to be removed by the Flux controllers.
This rarely occurred causing clusters to be stuck in locked states. The new solution will always remove resources in the correct order, making sure that all finalizers are removed before Kubernetes considers the resource to be fully removed from Terraform.

The plan forward is to only work on developing the new Terraform resource, initially focusing on ironing out any early bugs. While the new resource is stable there may occur some breaking attribute changes to deal with unforeseen use cases. While having said that feedback
is needed to make the Terraform experience with Flux better, so please start evaluating the new Terraform resource. A migration guide is available which walks through the step-by-step process for how to migrate between the old and new solution without breaking an existing Flux installation.
When the attributes in the new resource are considered set, the old data sources will be deprecated, and eventually removed. Until then it is recommended to start looking at which features are missing in the new resource to cover specific use cases.

## 0.12.0

This prerelease includes flux2 [v0.28.2](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.28.2).

Flux v0.28 comes with breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes.
Please see the [Upgrade Flux to the Source v1beta2 API](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/discussions/2567)
discussion for more details.

### Breaking changes

With the introduction of Source v1beta2, there is a breaking change that
requires a manual state update.

All that is required is to remove the `kubectl_manifest` resource for the
GitRepository manifest. This will cause the kubectl provider to overwrite the
existing manifest.

```shell
terraform state rm 'kubectl_manifest.sync["source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1/gitrepository/flux-system/flux-system"]'
```

Future versions of the provider will solve this long term.

This prerelease includes flux2 [v0.18.3](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.18.3).

Flux v0.18 comes with breaking changes, new features, performance improvements and many bug fixes.

Please see the [Upgrade to Flux v0.18 and the v1beta2 API](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/discussions/1916) discussion for more details.

**Breaking changes**
With the introduction of Kustomization v1beta2 there is a breaking change that requires a manual state update.

All that is required is to remove the `kubectl_manifest` resource for the Kustomization manifest. This will cause the kubectl provider to overwrite the existing manifest.

```shell
terraform state rm 'kubectl_manifest.sync["kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1/kustomization/flux-system/flux-system"]'
```

Future versions of the provider will solve this long term.
