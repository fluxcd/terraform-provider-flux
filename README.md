# terraform-provider-flux

This is a Terraform provider for Flux v2, it enables bootstrap a Kubernetes custer with Flux v2 using terraform.

## Example Usage

The provider is consists of two data sources `flux_install` and `flux_sync` the data sources are corresponding to [fluxv2 manifests](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fluxcd/flux2@v0.2.1/pkg/manifestgen)

The data sources are returing `YAML` manifest so a second provider is needed to apply the manifest into the Kubernetes cluster. See example folder.

The `flux_install` generates manifests to install the `fluxv2` components.

```hcl
# Flux
data "flux_install" "main" {
  target_path = "staging-cluster"
}
```

`flux_sync` the initial source manifest.

```hcl
data "flux_sync" "main" {
  target_path = "staging-cluster"
  url         = "ssh://git@github.com/${var.github_owner}/${var.repository_name}.git"
}
```
